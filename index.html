              <strong>The Green Mile</strong> - At a Louisiana assisted-living home, elderly retiree Paul Edgecomb becomes emotional while viewing the film Top Hat.

              <strong>The Terminal</strong> - Viktor Navorski, a traveler from the fictional country of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, only to discover that his passport is not valid. The United States does not recognize Krakozhia's new government after a coup, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as his passport is no longer considered valid. Because of this, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizes his passport and return ticket pending resolution of the issue. He becomes a refugee and is forced to live at Kennedy International Airport.
            </li>

              <strong>City of Ember

He hides his homosexuality and his status as an AIDS patient from the other members of the firm. A partner in the firm notices a lesion on Beckett's forehead. Although Beckett attributes the lesion to a racquetball injury, it indicates Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining condition.
